            "general": <info to be retrieved on every query, rarely altered, basically learnt the first time this field was added>
            <key>:<string>,
            <key>:<string>,
            ...
            "misc.": [...set of strings] // for all the stuff that doesn't necessarily match with a key
        }
    }
